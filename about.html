            <p> hi! as mentioned before, i'm a student from california studying computer science (as well as cognitive neuroscience) at Brown University.
              aside from this, i like the calm and seemingly mundane: grocery shopping, helping my mother with cooking, listening to music (men i trust <3), 
              and pottery. 
            </p>
            <p>
              (you might also suspect that i enjoy drawing, based on the various ukiyo-e style images scattered throughout the website. unfortunately, this is not
              one of the hobbies i had listed above. these images are ai generated by stable diffusion, which are much better than what i could possibly produce...)
            </p>
            <p> so what is this portfolio about? i took a uiux course during my fall 2022 semester, to which i've worked on a multitude of projects (4 of which are showcased on the main page).
              i hope to relay my growth from the beginning of the semester, where i had limited frontend skills, to being able to create responsive and interactive websites.
            </p>
            <p>
              i hope you enjoy experiencing my uiux progression with each project that you view.
            </p>
